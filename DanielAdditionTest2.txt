Spin the Dawn
by Elizabeth Lim

Summary
Maia Tamarin dreams of becoming the greatest tailor in the land, 
but as a girl, the best she can hope for is to marry well. 
When a royal messenger summons her ailing father, once a tailor of renown, 
to court, Maia poses as a boy and takes his place. 
She knows her life is forfeit if her secret is discovered, 
but she'll take that risk to achieve her dream and save her family from ruin. 
There's just one catch: Maia is one of twelve tailors vying for the job.
